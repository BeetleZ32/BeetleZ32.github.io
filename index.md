### CPSC120

* [Lab 2](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-02-BeetleZ32) : Even though Lab 2 wasn't challenging I still would put this as one of my top 3 labs due to this being my first experience with code and I still think it's crazy to see how far I've gone in coding.  Going from something so simple as a converter to actual moving images.  

* [Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-06-abraham) : I like Lab 6 due to the pattern that we made just from code. The code was pretty confusing, but it was pretty cool how we used for loops in order to create rows and columns.  Also how we coded it so the pattern moves the * as it descends was pretty cool as well.

* [Lab 7](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-07-abraham-by-self) : Lab 7 had to be my favorite due to how we made code that we had previously done and made it more efficient and cleaner to look at.  I always thought that the earlier labs were very "expanded" and even though it worked it didn't look pleasing at all. With this lab it solves the problems I had with my code before and makes it look cleaner to look at.
