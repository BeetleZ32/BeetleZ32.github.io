### CPSC120

* [Lab 2](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-02-BeetleZ32) : Even though Lab 2 wasn't challenging I still would put this as one of my Top 3 Labs due to this being my first experience with code and I still think it's crazy to see how far I've gone in coding.  Going from something so simple as a converter to actual moving images.
